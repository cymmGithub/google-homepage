Hello 
    My name is Przemek, this is my Google homepage clone.
In this project I used  CSS and HTML. While doing this project I learned,
basics of technologies mentioned before, like:
- importing fonts/images to my site;
- styling my site with basic shadow effects; 
- grounded my knowladge about CSS flexbox so i can put elements i want,
  where i want on in my project;
- many more....
Although this Google homepage clone can be improved for sure(like making site fully responsive),
im very happy from work.

Enjoy!
